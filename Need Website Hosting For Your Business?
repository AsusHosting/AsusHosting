We created the Website Acceleration Suite as a way to get all sites to load faster. This is better for your users, and good for SEO: we know how much 
importance Google attaches to web page loading speed.

is minified. That’s not all: there are over 40 performance-boosting features that you can use to fine-tune your website.

We also made a safe ‘one-click’ option for those who don’t have the time or inclination to get too technical. Toggle it on, and you’ll see immediate, 
dramatic improvements.
